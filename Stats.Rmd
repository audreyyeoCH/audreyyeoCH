#### <span style = "color: green;">A mathematical proof of $S_{A}(t) = S_{B}(t)^{HR}$, the Proportional hazards assumption.</span> 



I provide an example assuming we are comparing the efficacy of two treatment groups:

 + Treatment A, denoted as A, has survival curve $S_{A}(t)$

 + Treatment B, denoted as B, has survival curve $S_{B}(t)$
 
Other important notations include :

 + Hazard **rate** $h_{A}(t)$ with dependancy to time $t$
 
 + Hazard **ratio** $HR$
 
 + multiplication "${.}$"

The proportional hazards assumption is such that the hazard functions for any individual is a fixed proportion of hazard to any other covariate. 

Since we are interested in proofing this equation (1) :

$$
S_{A}(t) = S_{B}(t)^{HR}
$$
We denote the following as equation (2) :
$$
exp^{(-h_{A}(t))} = exp^{(-h_{B}(t))} {.} \space {HR} 
$$

We know the following, that the hazard function is the negative log of the Survival curve : 

$$
h(t) = -logS(t)
$$
Inversely, the exponential of the negative hazard function is the Survival curve :
$$
S(t) = exp(-h(t))
$$

Therefore, rewriting  (2) we obtain : 

$$
\frac {exp^{(-H_{A}(t))}}  {exp^{(-H_{B}(t))}} = {HR}  = \frac {exp(log S(t))} {exp(log{S(t))}}
$$
Which can be simplified to equation (3), **two minus signs in the former**: 

$$ exp^{-\int h_{A}(u) \space du - \space(-\int h_{B}(u) \space du) }  = \frac {exp^{(-\int h_{A}(u) \space du} } {exp^{-\int h_{B}(u) \space du  }} = HR $$

which resembles the hazard function with covariates:

$$
h_{A}(t)
 = h_{B} \space {.} \space exp^{(\vec{X\space }^{T} \vec{B})} = exp^{-\int h_{A}(u) \space du - \space(-\int h_{B}(u) \space du) }
$$
Where we fit a proportional hazards model :

$$
\frac {exp^{-log(S_{A}(t))}}  {exp^{-log(-S_{B}(t))}} = \frac {h_{A}(t)} {h_{B}(t)} = exp^{(\vec{X\space }^{T} \vec{B})}
$$

We recognise this result with equation (3).
