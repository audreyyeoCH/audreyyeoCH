### A March 2024 update since early beginnings of Learning Julia

Just about a week ago, I taught colleagues in my organisation (Roche, Basel Headquarters) "DataFrames, Strings and Plots". With the necessity of teaching, the learning did indeed transmit. We covered `types` in Julia such as `Dict`, `Pairs`, `Arrays` and reviewed the purpose of `.toml` files as an ambition that our students will eventually collaborate with the Julia programming language. 
Conscience that the recycled example of the `DataFrames` package was a eurocentric one (the DataFrame "German" was a universal one from this package `DataFrame.jl`) I created a `DataFrame` type of the ten countries belonging to South East Area, and those who participated in the SEA Games (South Eastern Games) and those who aren't as an example of a binary variable. Furthermore, I added another binary variable of `Indigenous` to represent whether or not that country had Indigenous population. Most did and hopefully made the lesson more diverse and interesting for a European-resident audience. This data frame was purposely erroneous in that it had Switzerland which does not belong to South East Asia so as a deliberate exercise, we manipulated this data frame to correct this error. All proved to be planted seeds for a more diversity inclusive instruction.

I continue to learn from my co-instructors for this in-house course lasting till June 2024 this year where we will continue to cover more statistics related material. A grass-roots effort I am so happy to be part of.

### Early beginnings

Two weeks ago, I stumbled across `Julia` the language from a simple google search on making `R` faster. I had a goal initially to start my C++ courses, due to a Triumphant year that was 2023, I did not get to it, until I discovered some extra headspace where the language `Julia` took a priority due to its intuitive syntax, ease and promise of faster performance. My criteria for picking teachers is not so stringent, and with Julia for Nervous beginners, the criterion of a welcoming intent was met with the instructor.

### A course at Julia Academy : Julia for Nervous Beginners, Week 1-2

Within the [Julia Academy](juliaacademy.com), I found a [course by Henri Laurie](https://juliaacademy.com/courses/julia-programming-for-nervous-beginners) (2021), a retired professor from the University of Cape Town, ZA who gave a 4 weeks course ranging from 1 hour to 3 hours per week. Illustrations were via the terminal of Henri's computer and promised exercises were in the end absent. According to the stackoverflow, Henri neither had the funding nor energy to complete the course with exercises as well. However, coupled with my advanced `R` skills (\~5-7 years), I breezed through Week 1 and 2 of the course, and relied on the qualities of a good teacher to push through the topics of reading and manipulating text files in `Julia` which I did not find so interesting.

### Week 2 and 3 of Julia for Nervous beginners: Appreciating R via Julia and Julia via R

My relative smooth start with Julia has helped me appreciate R at the same time. Week 2-3 focussed on the nature of Julia. The type system of R was something I never focussed on until (working in software engineering) and now, learning about Julia. Other examples include : what is a block scope, what is scope in relation to functions, what are type strings versus characters, concepts I never thought too deeply about when writing in R. Neither did I attend to the differences made in Julia between single quotation (for character) and double quotation marks (for string) in which R is the same. The similarities are also such as the `filter` call in the `tidyverse` package of R make for neat manipulations or strings or arrays.

Conversely, my background in `R` helped me understand the lessons about `If` and `Else` blocks, `While` loops and `For` loops. It introduced Anonymous function which are unnamed functions but like one, maps variables it will iterate over. What are its future potentials ? An undiscovered territory for me.

### Putting things to practice : In search for a Julia IDE (application/interface) for a Mac machine

As I learn with hands-on application, I searched quickly for a Julia IDE and found a [web-based](replit.com) one called `Replit` which automatically requested a link to my `github`account which I did not see relevance nor aid to my learning. The said IDE likened to the one of VS Code however when I ran the code, I would always be led into a foreign window of which felt like a point of no return. Discovering a new IDE and its workflow is often a prohibitive step for a novice, but I still wanted to concertedly do the in-lecture exercises of Julia for Nervous beginners so I resorted to doing it via my good old Mac terminal. It was so pleasant.

Determined to get Visual Studio Code (VS) app working, I downloaded it and its Julia extension and found a frustrating block on finding my Julia.exe path in order that the code ran. I finally googled "How to find my MAC application path" and it was another solution via the Mac terminal : `whereis Julia`. The short cut commands to run code line-by-line on the VS Code app are different between a Windows machine and a Mac, so many tutorials that I watched catered for the former which extra internet searches was required to help me see that a `option+Enter` or `shift+Enter` would do just that. Whereas `Alt+Enter` will evaluate all the code in the entire file. These short cut keys will automatically open the Julia REPL where you should see `julia>` appearing. `julia> exit()` will close the REPL and expand the window of the editor.

Further to that, only files in the VS code workspace would be executed and not just any new file within the bounds of the VS code application. I am still understanding how this is so.

### Future outlook : Statistical computing with Julia

I discovered some more courses in coursera, such as [Scientific Computing With Julia](https://www.coursera.org/learn/julia-programming), however the current focus of mine differs to its learning objectives. There aren't many statistical use cases which is precisely the direction of my Julia learning. Thus I hesitated from starting another course, albeit be run by the same, kind teacher.

The next steps include re-running the [Turing code](https://turinglang.org/stable/tutorials/00-introduction/) on my `.jl` files as an exercise to familliarise myself with the VS Code app, and eventually linking it to my github account. I have yet to discover the Weave feature of the Julia extension, no internet source has explained why I haven't discovered my Julia markdown file format, even if I forcefully save `.txt` files as `.jmd` . I found importing packages within Julia a bit slow, and within R a bit faster. At the end of the course, Henri Laurie spoke about future outlooks of Julia, and how with just the knowledge of this course, one can run an MCMC experiment. More than, other IDEs were introduced such as [Juno](junolab.org) and [IJulia](https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl/stable/manual/running/) Those will be my next steps to understand a comfortable setting to write and run Julia. There are undiscovered potentials as a statistical software engineer within Julia, and I can't wait to integratively understand the said benefits of this language such as its type system and multiple dispatches. The learning is long-term and seemingly compoundable when reflecting between programming languages. Future experiences will nourish these planted seeds.
