## How did I make my start in the Julia Language ? 

I stumbled across `Julia` the language from a simple google search on making `R` faster. I had a goal initially to start my C++ courses, due to a consuming year that was 2023, I did not get to it, until I discovered some headspace where the language `Julia` took a priority due to its intuitive syntax, ease and promise of faster performance.

Within the [Julia Academy](juliaacademy.com), I found a [course by Henri Laurie](https://juliaacademy.com/courses/julia-programming-for-nervous-beginners) (2021), a retired professor from the University of Cape Town, ZA who gave a 4 weeks course ranging from 1 hour to 1.5 hour per week. My criteria for picking teachers is not so stringent, and here, the criterion of a welcoming intent was met. Coupled with my advanced `R` skills (\~5-7 years), I breezed through Week 1 and 2 of the course, and relied on the qualities of a good teacher to push through the topics of reading and manipulating text files in `Julia`.

## In the middle : Appreciating R via Julia and Julia via R

My tremendously smooth start with Julia has helped me appreciate R at the same time. The type system of R was something I never cared about until (working in software engineering) and seeing something different. Other examples include : what is a block scope, what is scope in relation to functions, what are type strings versus characters, concepts I never thought too deeply about when writing in R. Neither did I attend to the differences made in Julia between single (for character) and double quotation marks (for string) in R which imitates the same. The similarities are such as the `filter` call in the `tidyverse` package of R make for neat manipulations or strings or arrays.

Conversely, my background in `R` helped me understand the lessons about \`If\` and `Else` blocks, `While` loops and `For` loops. It introduced Anonymous function which are unnamed functions but like one, maps variables it will iterate over. What are its future potentials ? An undiscovered territory for me.

## Searching for a Julia IDE

As I learn with hands-on application, I searched quickly for a Julia IDE and found a [web-based](replit.com) one called `Replit` which automatically requested a link to my `github`account which I did not see relevance nor aid to my learning. The said IDE likened to the one of VS Code however when I ran the code, I would always be led into a foreign window of which felt like a point of no return. Discovering a new IDE and its workflow is often a prohibitive step for a novice, but I still wanted to concertedly do the in-lecture exercises of Julia for Nervous beginners so I resorted to doing it via my good old Mac terminal. It was so pleasant ... to also write BASH code again.

Determined to get Visual Studio Code (VS) app working, I downloaded it and its Julia extension and found a frustrating block on finding my Julia.exe path in order that the code ran. The short cut commands to run code line-by-line on the VS Code app are different between a Windows machine and a Mac, so many tutorials that I watched catered for the former which extra internet searches was required to help me see that a `option+Enter`\` or `shift+Enter` would do just that.

Further to that, only files in the VS code workspace would be executed and not just any new file within the bounds of the VS code application. I am still awaiting an explanation for this.

## Next steps

I discovered some more courses in coursera, such as [Scientific Computing With Julia](https://www.coursera.org/learn/julia-programming), however the current focus of mine differs to its learning objectives. There aren't many statistical use cases which is precisely the direction of my Julia learning. Thus I hesitated from starting another course, albeit be run by the same, kind teacher.

The next steps include re-running the [Turing code](https://turinglang.org/stable/tutorials/00-introduction/) on my `.jl` files as an exercise to familliarise myself with the VS Code app, and eventually linking it to my github account. I have yet to discover the Weave feature of the Julia extension, no internet source has explained why I haven't discovered my Julia markdown file format, even if I forcefully save `.txt` files as `.jmd` . I found importing packages within Julia a bit slow, and within R a bit faster. At the end of the course, Henri Laurie spoke about future outlooks of Julia, and how with just the knowledge of this course, one can run an MCMC experiment. More than, other IDEs were introduced such as [Juno](junolab.org) and [IJulia](https://julialang.github.io/IJulia.jl/stable/manual/running/) Those will be my next steps to understand a comfortable setting to write and run Julia. There are undiscovered potentials as a statistical software engineer within Julia, and I can't wait to integratively understand the said benefits of this language such as its type system and multiple dispatches. The learning is long-term and seemingly compoundable when reflecting between programming languages. Future experiences will nourish these planted seeds.
