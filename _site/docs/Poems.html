<p>Dr Henri Laurie (Uni Cape Town, ZA), Julia Programming for Nervous
beginners :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The kind of truth that is embodied in fine pottery is not same as
the truth in beautiful poetry, and the truth that is captured in a
computer program is far from both of these. But in the end, all three
forms use the expressive power of the medium to get at truth …
Programmers are, in that sense, like artists and poets”</p>

<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
<p>These poems are like a revision of histories</p>
<p>Of yours, of mine, of somebody’s</p>
<p>They are glimmers explained in cryptic themes</p>
<p>I pluck the root up to discover</p>
<p>My hands have moonshine before</p>
<p>And in poetry I build a home</p>
<p>For orphaned feelings to find lustre</p>

<div id="feverish-dream" class="section level2">
<h2>Feverish dream</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, Famille Yeo, Basel Stadt (2023)</p>
<p>It was a feverish night</p>
<p>But in the darkness i saw a phone light</p>
<p>Me in the swimming changerooms</p>
<p>You were living in Sydney</p>
<p>Me in Melbourne</p>
<p>But on a Wednesday the night of a fever</p>
<p>You wrote to me</p>
<p>And I saw your muscular features</p>
<p>The light curls that dragged on your shoulders</p>
<p>The side profiles and your upper arm structures</p>
<p>In light mood that I’ve never seen</p>
<p>In more or less openness, that I’ve never been</p>
<p>My Emilien, the moonlight from a phone</p>
<p>I had a fever but I was not alone</p>
<p>I was swimming in a colorful lens</p>
<p>I liked the rose-tinted pictures in the sand</p>
<p>Asked if we should finally meet</p>
<p>But you were already home in Sydney</p>
<p>I woke from the fever and thought to myself</p>
<p>I bet you had never experience a union like ours</p>
<p>And thought it won’t be possible for now</p>
<p>For I counted that it would be 13 years at least</p>
<p>Till you’ll be well</p>
<p>It was a feverish night but I allowed</p>
<p>To dream of the fusion we made for ourselves</p>
<p>And reminded myself of the crying after every frown</p>
<p>It was a nice but feverish dream</p>
<p>As fictional were the lens we were in</p>
<p>We were soft inside</p>
<p>And feeling free</p>

<div id="december-heart" class="section level2">
<h2>December heart</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, Polyterasse, Zürich (2023)</p>
<p>That’s a December heart</p>
<p>Under autumn leaves that grew old</p>
<p>A funeral of dreams of once bright leaves</p>
<p>As if they had to gently cradle my soft heart</p>
<p>And fading spirit</p>
<p>Put a sad song on and watch the ceremony of my grieving</p>
<p>Leading down the isle</p>
<p>As we watch dreams leave for many miles</p>
<p>In the Zurich train</p>
<p>In the Lausanne line</p>
<p>Being in the middle</p>
<p>Hours at a time</p>
<p>The roof was my home</p>
<p>The passengers my neighbours</p>
<p>The families who harmed</p>
<p>Because their emotions were disabled</p>
<p>The in between of being myself and what served them</p>
<p>The gender bias weaponizing words like : “she was playing a
victim”</p>
<p>I reached the altar</p>
<p>And left my aspirations there</p>
<p>Let the dapper flannel omit himself from his cruel dare</p>
<p>Let the ghost out of my head and hands</p>
<p>Let the facts trump hope</p>
<p>For my new low</p>
<p>Watched potentials undressed themselves</p>
<p>And felt my knee weakened a last amount</p>
<p>Found the author of my demise</p>
<p>Told her I loved her and to count her sadness twice</p>
<p>Bought her new shoes and played her</p>
<p>A thirteen-minute song</p>
<p>Said she could stay at the altar</p>
<p>Even after the darkness has gone</p>

<h2>The Push and Pull</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, Famille Yeo, Basel Stadt (2023)</p>
<p>The tips of trees show their fingers</p>
<p>Of yellow leaves catching the sunrise</p>
<p>As if we all had the privilege</p>
<p>Of receiving autumn twice</p>
<p>The tips of trees show up as fringes</p>
<p>Of yellow brick roads ahead</p>
<p>My younger sister singing the Beatles</p>
<p>A lasting Sunshine at eight</p>
<p>The tips of my fingers don’t feel the cold</p>
<p>Under puffy, bronze sleeves I afford</p>
<p>The roof over my head, some dignities I sold</p>
<p>Sometimes grateful and thankfully not</p>
<p>The glacial streams carved out my path</p>
<p>I was blessed by the Inn only twice</p>
<p>This girl who said she’d live in Basel</p>
<p>Arrived safely at the Rhine</p>
<p>I wish to hold hand-in-hand</p>
<p>With dreams I bear to fruit</p>
<p>My perceptions only catching up</p>
<p>To all of the push and the pull</p>

<div id="the-night-cat" class="section level2">
<h2>The Night Cat</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, Collingwood - Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>The brush of air gave her wings</p>
<p>The wheels that travel at great length</p>
<p>In a city that bends hearts to its knees</p>
<p>The infectious giggle that she spreads</p>
<p>A heart that beats and sends the fuel</p>
<p>To tell the feet to instigate</p>
<p>A wheel in front, then a wheel behind</p>
<p>A city I share my traffic crimes</p>
<p>The crush of leaves in March and April</p>
<p>The soft wet grass with leaves of Maple</p>
<p>To Johnston street I turn the right</p>
<p>And meet rigidity at the red light</p>
<p>A clear September I stray from west</p>
<p>To watch the East Melbourne version of sun set</p>
<p>And frolic at night under the Melbourne rain</p>
<p>To see moonshine</p>
<p>These tram tracks bring</p>
<p>I remember the nights of Irish banter</p>
<p>The orange dress, the multi-coloured encounters</p>
<p>The dark blue nights at the Night cat</p>
<p>The lacey, racey trapezius and my Innsbruck hat</p>
<p>At the Northcote bar</p>
<p>The Middle East Band playing has so far</p>
<p>Been the heartstrings that</p>
<p>Bring on so much to remember,</p>
<p>The girl in shoes from Smith,</p>
<p>The Audrey Hepburn earrings on Brunswick</p>
<p>We were one of a kind</p>
<p>I liked that we kept our hearts open</p>
<p>Without ever questioning why</p>

<div id="under-the-water-is-the-sages" class="section level2">
<h2>Under the Water is the Sages</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, Fitzoy Pool, Melbourne, Australia (2012)</p>
<p>It starts with a drizzle</p>
<p>And it hits your arms</p>
<p>You rise above and the view is marred</p>
<p>Racing grey moist is taken by clumps</p>
<p>The Banshee cries with the angry storm</p>
<p>You rise above the pool and hear</p>
<p>Her cries that dry all wounds beneath</p>
<p>And flutter as you catch on fear</p>
<p>That warmth and shelter isn’t near</p>
<p>The wind that tends to whet each drop</p>
<p>Of Rain and sends you to a shock</p>
<p>But you find no way on land to go</p>
<p>Your sight improves as you swim below</p>
<p>Oh dear the view is Clarity</p>
<p>And now you see the route of forces</p>
<p>Of traps and diversions you can go</p>
<p>Your mind’s at ease at even losses</p>
<p>And even when the water rises</p>
<p>And Banshee’s blood is bled on it</p>
<p>Her cries aren’t heard under the water</p>
<p>But my eyes do see where this path leads</p>
<p>The racing clouds do not stop</p>
<p>Fleeting past the ranges</p>
<p>Anarchy or peace it may tell</p>
<p>Under the water is the sages</p>

<div id="tame" class="section level2">
<h2>Tame</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, Famille Yeo, Basel Stadt (2023)</p>
<p>It was a very short song</p>
<p>The universe sang to me</p>
<p>I didn’t know I had to take it in</p>
<p>Before it promised nothing to me</p>
<p>I play the tune</p>
<p>Again and again</p>
<p>My body now knows</p>
<p>That I have been tamed</p>
<p>For the time wasted</p>
<p>and meeting my own disinterest</p>
<p>I promise I will take notes</p>
<p>Because this isn’t a first</p>
<p>It was a very short song</p>
<p>Based on a true story</p>
<p>But I will write myself the one</p>
<p>About Briefcase energies</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="briefcase-energies" class="section level2">
<h2>Briefcase energies</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, Silhpost, Zürich (2023)</p>
<p>It’s a competition because we regress</p>
<p>if one step is taken the other should be left</p>
<p>I dig into the underside of binary</p>
<p>It’s where we meet our match</p>
<p>Jars will break and butterflies, released</p>
<p>And then you’ll hold my hand</p>
<p>The pink and purple amiss</p>
<p>Across the Zürich skies</p>
<p>Saw that I had been</p>
<p>Kissing famous boys</p>
<p>But I tire from lost souls and let them be</p>
<p>For eyes that follow me have briefcase energies</p>
<p>And the binary of this underside</p>
<p>I root for hearts with holes inside</p>
<p>It’s where I met a catch</p>
<p>This human with his briefcase, a compass and a map</p>
<p>His chestnut eyes dissolve</p>
<p>The competition it involves</p>
<p>The pink and purple skies,</p>
<p>I, the sun, and he the flower:</p>
<p>A proper briefcase might</p>

<h2>The prey becomes the hunter</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, De Wette Park, Basel Stadt (2023)</p>
<p>The opened jar of butterflies</p>
<p>The hovering clouds of grey inside</p>
<p>The feet perched by her</p>
<p>Stabilizing the both of you</p>
<p>The Saccharine ways she was overdramatic and true</p>
<p>It was not a deceiving prose</p>
<p>She said she meant to say every single word</p>
<p>And yours spoke to block paths</p>
<p>Because you weren’t convince you deserved this much</p>
<p>Love and understanding has become confusing</p>
<p>To the brain that was damaged by the abusing</p>
<p>There, there, stay over there</p>
<p>She’s merely human so keep your truths and pick your dares</p>
<p>Wisely</p>
<p>For your lack of understanding has become abusive</p>
<p>Your honeyed words, they become self-serving</p>
<p>And the love you met on a Tuesday</p>
<p>May be worth protecting</p>

<div id="marketplace" class="section level2">
<h2>Marketplace</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, Elisabethen Kirche, Basel Stadt (2023)</p>
<p>What will you do with a blank page</p>
<p>Will it be a story of morality and sage</p>
<p>I promised mine would be interesting when I was eight</p>
<p>Like the Levi’s wearing brunette</p>
<p>Leaning against a rain-proof chair</p>
<p>Dapper in blue and collared for the evening</p>
<p>Ready to meet his future something</p>
<p>At the marketplace</p>
<p>A tight rope for me to walk in good faith</p>
<p>To pay things forward without knowing my steps ahead</p>
<p>But I liked that we met at the marketplace</p>
<p>And at my favourite route near Bankverein</p>
<p>I felt your dapper flannel leaning against mine</p>
<p>On purpose and several times</p>
<p>It was obvious that the Irish band playing was a sign</p>
<p>At the market place</p>
<p>Where you found sweetness in our morality and sage</p>
<p>And proceeded to tell me so</p>
<p>I was music to your ears</p>
<p>Till the night brought us home</p>

<div id="the-ducks-and-ama" class="section level2">
<h2>The ducks and Ama</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, at the Rhine, Kleinbasel side, Switzerland
(2021)</p>
<p>I asked the ducks in the water</p>
<p>If they have seen my Ama</p>
<p>If the water they touch, touched her</p>
<p>If the streams they brush their feathers with</p>
<p>Held all five of her fingers on each of her hand</p>
<p>and tell her… we haven’t let her go</p>
<p>and we will one day return</p>
<p>and be hand in hand like</p>
<p>the younger me she would not let go…</p>
<p>I wonder how to reach her</p>
<p>Knowing she is buried down under …</p>
<p>Will the coffin disintegrate</p>
<p>and rain dilute her to the waters</p>
<p>Will she meet me in Switzerland ?</p>
<p>Where we can be together</p>
<p>Will my Akung’s words be true ?</p>
<p>When he said :</p>
<p>“<em>We will always be with you</em>”</p>
<p>I know the ducks pass by: “Hello stranger!…</p>
<p>…Do you know my Ama ? … She was <em>my</em> grandma”</p>
<p>A favourite parent: she liked safety, having enough for us to eat,
being clean.</p>
<p>She kept the children healthy</p>
<p>When there was dengue.</p>
<p>Do you know her… little duckies?…</p>
<p>Because in a lot of ways, <em>I am so much like her</em></p>
<p>… sturdy, efficient and I like numbers</p>
<p>Will you tell her when you see her to not let us go ?</p>
<p>I know she hates complainers</p>
<p>but I just miss her so.</p>

<h2>Sunshine for itself</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, Rittergasse x Wettsteinbrücke, Basel Stadt
(2023)</p>
<p>I don’t know if you noticed</p>
<p>That spring ruined flowers</p>
<p>No shade for relief</p>
<p>No light to nourish</p>
<p>I don’t know if you noticed</p>
<p>They took the sunshine for themselves</p>
<p>Nevermind the herbs abreasts</p>
<p>Or the chirping birds in the Innenhof confusing</p>
<p>The east and the west</p>
<p>I don’t know if their petals learned</p>
<p>If they were worthy or not</p>
<p>Will they find all their faces</p>
<p>And only chose one from the lot</p>
<p>The fall is near,</p>
<p>Their buds already burned</p>
<p>What will sisters scheme next</p>

<h2>The Magic Green of the Rhine</h2>
<p><em>Audrey Yeo</em>, La Rhine x Burgweg, Switzerland (2021)</p>
<p>I see how this goes</p>
<p>When things between us start ending</p>
<p>I see the river course reversing</p>
<p>The steps back are crushing</p>
<p>The retracting amount to hurt</p>
<p>You know it was you who waved at me first</p>
<p>I,</p>
<p>See how this goes</p>
<p>When things between us start ending</p>
<p>I saw the sun hit the river and it gloat</p>
<p>The magic green of the Rhine turned to a ghost …</p>
<p>Destabilizing my universe,</p>
<p>I thought I shared bounds of land with you</p>
<p>And we were mastering our respective fools</p>
<p>A reflection of sun by water</p>
<p>My stature so short did I ever reach the magic river</p>
<p>But the ocean soon came out to dissolve</p>
<p>Green jade of glacier from our mountain tops</p>
<p>The empty expecting mirth</p>
<p>You laughed out loud</p>
<p>Excused by the afternoon wind</p>
<p>It paralyzes me so I can never win</p>
<p>I was drenched by river</p>
<p>or so I thought</p>
<p>I was once your lover</p>
<p>and now I am not</p>
