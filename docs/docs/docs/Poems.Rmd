_Introduction_

These poems are like a revision of histories

Of yours, of mine, of somebody's

They are triggers explained in cryptic themes

I pluck the root up to discover

My hands have dirt before

So I am trying to recover

All the feelings I felt in red before

## Diversity Candidate
_Audrey Yeo_

I feel exposed

Like the wind caught me

Perforating my soul

Exposed I was two days ago

I am a solo trainee in this once in a lifetime journey

And while I move ahead I think I am slow

But are my frictions making traction or is speed my goal ?


I don't know if it's right to feel a certain instability

Like the world said I could come with

But it could also swallow me


My feet are perched but I feel them cycle in the air

I take flight and feel light but am never anywhere

Or is it that I've landed and I am having a ball

Or that I can feel safe now

But I don't know how to

Anymore

## Bye, "_Your Name_"

_Audrey Yeo_

I can't read your message anymore

Your unilateral disclosure took me by surprise

Been reading and trying to parse it day and night

This week I finally understood the end of the last line

It said "_Bye_", followed by your name

So I naturally thought of all the ways I was to blame

So I traced my steps back to find the red flags

To find our thirty-nine-minute-phone-call the night before

Where you were gentle for when you were actually sore

Then at 7 am the next morning

Before I got up but was still in dreaming

And I read line by line to interpret the meaning

I laughed because it was all too shocking



It cannot be true

At the end of the first night

You turned back at the SBB and found me smiling at you

And your knees pointing to me the whole evening

Your goodwill and my sincerity looked like they were competing

Then to find the fault on a Sunday-two-hour-phone-call

We only heard earnesty and more

So it cannot be that

You sent me good morning messages after that


Come today I could parse the shock in my body

Your message came off first as a triggered mistake

What will I do with the growth I was inspired to make ?


And the consequences of this brings on 

A cinema of thoughts

You made it out like it was all my fault

If you complained about all the seeming defeat

I'm the Basel girl asking you to tell me all about it

Or is it that it is all too much

For a grown up who seems to be developing a crush

With your well-being in mind, should I reply ?

Because you've asked that I become irrelevant to you

For all of time

## To All My Lovers
_Audrey Yeo_

This I promise to you all

That for now until the end of time

I may not always come from a place of strength

I will employ politeness and good manners

And all the conscience I can muster

Please forgive the oversights, I will have them

Please forgive the aberrations I make of the social contract 

I am finding out what kind of social being I am so,

This is a promise I make

For casual and lovely things

That accumulate in form and function

Being with good human beings

This time I am counting

All the ways to love

You all

And with the impending expiry is

I will remember more of your good will and deeds

So I will oversight your oversight

And see all the tries you make

Judge you only for your favourite mistakes - 

To all my lovers

I will know heartstrings exists

And solutions need waiting

While threads are threading 

until the last line -

I hope that I am a dream

Like many dreams you are after

and I hope that having had me

Makes your living a little easier

## Missing information
_Audrey Yeo_

I read the room correctly

And see what a haste you've made

The kind of irreversible and damaging, mistake

If we back-tracked

To see who hugged first and 

said we had the time

Then you'll have missing information

To find the good in your goodbye

## The girl crush
_Audrey Yeo_

I didn't think I would suffer the aftermath of her gaze

I didn't know I would feel unsafe around her eyeful embrace

That she could be a mother of two girls

Desperate for a friend and someone to hold

I didn't know

She could deploy a boomer's trickery

Flaunting wealth and ethnic superiority

That is certainly not friendship she seeks

Because she tells me he is ignoring her needs

I didn't know her gazes were not innocent

That she would rather look at me than out the fancy streets

That her desire for intimacy made her desire everyday with me

Her desperation made me the subject of her study

And I was expected to accept luxurious chocolate and uncalculated company

Did she not notice I left the park early

And said no to spending alone time with her in her one-person party

I didn't know how she would take a "no"

And I asked for space and distance too

But she would come again at my mail box

Activating dreams I am only made of

She is the danger

that I never thought of
