_These_ poems are like a revision of _dreams_

They are triggers explained in cryptic themes

I pluck the root up to discover

My hands have dirt before

And I am trying to recover

All the _feelings_ I wrote in red before

## Diversity Candidate


I feel exposed

Like the wind caught me

Perforating my soul

Exposed I was two days ago

*I am a solo trainee in this once in a lifetime journey*

And while I move ahead I think I am slow

*But are my frictions making traction or is speed my goal* ?


I don't know if it's right to feel a certain instability

Like the world said I could come with

*But it could also swallow me*


My feet are perched but I feel them cycle in the air

I take flight and feel light but am never anywhere

Or is it that I've landed and I am having a ball

Or that I can feel safe now

But I don't know how to

Anymore

## Bye, "Your Name"



I can't read your message anymore

Your unilateral disclosure took me by surprise

Been reading and trying to parse it day and night

This week I finally understood the end of the last line

It said "Bye", followed by your name

So I naturally thought of all the ways I was to blame

So I traced my steps back to find the red flags

To find our thirty nine minute phone call the night before

Where you were gentle for when you were actually sore

Then at 7 am the next morning

Before I got up but was still in dreaming

And I read line by line to interpret the meaning

I laughed because it was all too shocking



It cannot be true

At the end of the first night

Your turned back at the SBB and found me smiling at you

And your knees pointing to me the whole evening

Your goodwill and my sincerity looked like they were competing

Then to find the fault on a Sunday-two-hour-phone-call

We only heard earnesty and more

So it cannot be that

You sent me good morning messages after that


Come today I could parse the shock in my body

Your message came off first as a triggered mistake

*What will I do with the growth I was inspired to make ?*


And the consequences of this brings on 

A cinema of thoughts

You made it out like it was all my fault

*If you complained about all the seeming defeat*

*I would be staying right here asking you to tell me all about it*

<!-- I would have found more comfort in talking only about it -->
Or is it that it is all too much

For a grown up who seems to be developing a crush

With your well-being in mind, should I reply ?

Because you asked that I become irrelevant to you

For all of time
