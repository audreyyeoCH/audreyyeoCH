## Welcome and enjoy my original poems :

These poems are like a revision of dreams
They are triggers explained in cryptic themes
I pluck the root up to discover
My hands have dirt before
And I am trying to cover
All the feelings I wrote in red before

## Diversity

I feel exposed
Like the wind caught me
Perforating my soul
Exposed I was two days ago
I am a solo trainee in this once in a lifetime journey
And while I move ahead I think I am slow
But are my frictions making traction or is distince my goal ?

I don0t know if it's right to feel a certain instability
Like the world said I could come with
But it could also swalloe me

My feet are perched but I feel them cycle in the air
I tkae flight and feel light but am never anywhere
Or is it that I've landed nad I am having a ball
Or that I can feel safe onw
But I don't know how to
Anymore

## Bye, "Your Name"

I can't read your message anymore
Your unilateral disclosure took me by surprise
Been reading and trying to parse it day and night
This week I finally understood the end of the last line
It said "Bye", followed by your name
So I naturally thought of all the ways I was to blame
So I traced my steps back to find the red glads
To find our thirty nine minute phone call the night before
Where you were gentle for when you were actually sore
Then at 7 am the next morning
Beofre I got up but was still in dreaming
And I read line by line to interpret the meaning
I laughed because it was all too shocking

It cannot be true
At the end of the first night
Your turned back at the Ã–V and I was looking at you
And your knees pointing to me the whole evening
Our goodwill and sincerities looked like they were competing
Then to find the fault on a Sunday two hour phone call
We only heard good interntions and more
So it cannot be that
You sent me good morning messages after that

Come today I could parse hte shock in your message
It came off first as a triggered mistake
What will I do with the growth I was inspired to make ?

And the consequences of this brings on a cinema of thoughts
You made it out like it was all my fault
If you complained about all the seeming defeat
I would have found more comfort in talking only about it
Or is it that nothing could be enough
For a grown up who seems to be developing a crush
With your wellbeing in mind, should I reply ?
Because you asked that I become irrelevant to you
For all of time
