_Introduction_

These poems are like a revision of histories

Of yours, of mine, of somebody's

They are glimmers explained in cryptic themes

While I pluck the root up to discover

My hands have dirt before

In poetry I recover

All the feelings I felt, in <span style = "color: red;">red</span> before

## The ducks and Ama 

_Audrey Yeo_, at the Rhine, Kleinbasel side, Switzerland (2021)

I asked the ducks in the water

If they have seen my Ama

If the water they touch, touched her

If the streams they brush their feathers with

Held all five of her fingers on each of her hand

and tell her... we haven't let her go

and we will one day return

and be hand in hand like

the younger me she would not let go...

I wonder how to reach her

Knowing she is buried down under ...

Will the coffin disintegrate

and rain dilute her to the waters

Will she meet me in Switzerland ?

Where we can be together


Will my Akung's words be true ?

When he said :

"_We will always be with you_"

I know the ducks pass by: "Hello stranger!...

...Do you know my Ama ? ... She was _my_ grandma"

A favourite parent: she liked safety, having enough for us to eat, being clean.

She kept the children healthy

When there was dengue.

Do you know her... little duckies?...

Because in a lot of ways, _I am so much like her_ 

... sturdy, efficient and I like numbers

Will you tell her when you see her to not let us go ?

I know she hates complainers 

but I just miss her so.

## Sunshine for itself
_Audrey Yeo_, Gotthelf, Basel Stadt (2023)

I don't know if you noticed

That spring ruined flowers

No shade for relief

No hope to placate

I don't know if you noticed

They took the sunshine for themselves

Nevermind the herbs abreasts

Or the chirping birds in the Innenhof confusing

The east and the west

I don't know if their petals learned

If they were worthy or not 

Will they find all their faces

And only chose one from the lot

The fall is near, 

Their buds already burned

What will sisters scheme next

If they have killed their competition ?

## Briefcase energies
_Audrey Yeo_, Silhpost, Zürich (2023)

It's a competition because we regress

if one step is taken the other should be left

I dig into the underside of binary

It’s where we meet our match

Jars will break and butterflies, released

And then you'll hold my hand

The pink and purple amiss

Across the Zürich skies

Saw that I had been

Kissing famous boys

But I tire from lost souls and let them be

For eyes that follow me have briefcase energies

And the binary of this underside

I root for hearts with holes inside

It's where I met a catch

This human with his briefcase, a compass and a map

His chestnuts eyes dissolve

The competition it involves

The pink and purple summer skies, 

I, the sun, and he the flower:

A proper briefcase might

## The Magic Green of the Rhine
_Audrey Yeo_, at the Rhine near Burgweg, Kleinbasel, Switzerland (2021)

I see how this goes

When things between us start ending

I see the river course reversing

The steps back are crushing

The retracting amount to hurt

You know it was you who waved at me first

I,

See how this goes

When things between us start ending


I saw the sun hit the river and it gloat

The magic green of the Rhine turned to a ghost ...

Destabilizing my universe,

I thought I shared bounds of land with you

And we were mastering our respective fools

A reflection of sun by water

My stature so short did I ever reach the magic river

But the ocean soon came out to dissolve

Green jade of glacier from our mountain tops

The empty expecting mirth

You laughed out loud

Excused by the afternoon wind

It paralyzes me so I can never win

I was drenched by river 

or so I thought

I was once your lover

and now I am not
