_Introduction_


These poems are like a revision of histories

Of yours, of mine, of somebody's

They are glimmers explained in cryptic themes

I pluck the root up to discover

My hands have moonshine before

And in poetry I build a home

For orphaned feelings to find lustre

## The Defence of your life
_Audrey Yeo_, Locarno/Innsbruck (2024)

I can see why the Dapper flannel 

Chose to disregard

The unending gaze and the night light blush

On his face

And the awe at the tip of his tongue

That disturbed his gut

He saw love in his life

And covered it up

A defense mechanism

He adds sprinkles of negative bias

To a mad chemistry

To scheme the next confusing steps exactly

Against himself

He is the leading speaker

Of the silence that came from his mouth

In the Defense part of his life

Aiming with only a shield 

Seeing if the winds favor a man

Whose defense saw himself as the Meal

With a dangling stethoscope 

He braces for illness

Such that when the Sun and Rainbow sang a tune together

He found other signs of sickness

Which I believe is the slow messaging at me

For he once warmed my heart

By cupping shoulders and kissing emojis

Only for me to ache in pain

If humans don’t do things just once

Then he will certainly do this to me again

I watched myself almost wither twice

For a man giving the Defence of his life

The nonchalant facade mistrusting his insides

He throws feelings at whim and at first sight

But the only thing he owes me still

Is to do the decent things a human being will

Tuck the Flannel into Levi’s and leave

And take the mixed tape dreams

He made in me

## Rafaël
_Audrey Yeo_, Basel/Vienna (2024)

The non-stop rain in May

And the unpromising summer of June

A whift of air came in

Bringing in jasmine perfume

That is a future with and without you

My Raphaël

A turning point in history

Of vicious dreams that sell

Like a constant reinforcement

From mixtapes that tell

I was in, a closing cell

I let, the giving rain in May

Dilute the pain his silence gave in waves

I let the ablative sunrise

end ideas before it ends my remaining foresight

Rip up the words he sent just the same

Knowing he's not just a poem I named

But Music he scored onto my skin

My mid afternoon jasmine

Was forced to follow the wind

As I breath in and out the withdrawal inside 

And see that it was merely a cruel high

So I killed the day's scent one by one

It may months before I un-love a deceiving

Human

Let his gestures be about his revenge

Let the giving summer

restore the generosity in my human
HHHHH
Hold my heart out in uncharted terrains

Make pretend I have better things to gain

For this is a saccharine hell

I can be properly loved

But I won't be loved

By my Raphaël

## The ducks and Ama 
_Audrey Yeo_, at the Rhine, Kleinbasel side, Switzerland (2021)

I asked the ducks in the water

If they have seen my Ama

If the water they touch, touched her

If the streams they brush their feathers with

Held all five of her fingers on each of her hand

and tell her... we haven't let her go

and we will one day return

and be hand in hand like

the younger me she would not let go...

I wonder how to reach her

Knowing she is buried down under ...

Will the coffin disintegrate

and rain dilute her to the waters

Will she meet me in Switzerland ?

Where we can be together

Will my Akung's words be true ?

When he said :

"_We will always be with you_"

I know the ducks pass by: "Hello stranger!...

...Do you know my Ama ? ... She was _my_ grandma"

A favourite parent: she liked safety, having enough for us to eat, being clean.

She kept the children healthy

When there was dengue.

Do you know her... little duckies?...

Because in a lot of ways, _I am so much like her_ 

... sturdy, efficient and I like numbers

Will you tell her when you see her to not let us go ?

I know she hates complainers 

but I just miss her so.

## Conversations about leaving Ballet

_Audrey Yeo Famille Yeo (2024)_


I want to talk about Ballet

With dancers who also left silently

Where 

We don’t recall our last stretch or pirouette

Being in our last training for a difficult concert set

The discipline and respect for authority

For the piano player and choreographer

Haunting us till this day

There must have been some of us who were

A dancer in Ballet

I want to talk about leaving Ballet

But there’s no one here whose had that life

That dedication, that discipline or that obsessive strife

I want to find a familiar space

Where we can talk about the phantoms

That haunt us like an Artic haze

Where our current life abberates our

Phantom boundaries

That is or was our daily realities

Living in an unforgiving being

Of squared hips and shoulders

Of turn outs that don’t waver

Of hair buns that thicken

With doubts about our future

But the pink ribbons grip hands in history

I left a dance routine ungracefully

And I want to dance it out the street

About all the youth it had stolen from me

Of an art form that valued being thin

Of an industry that plagued my mental wellbeing

I got the scars and the body dysmorphia

The crooked toes did not help me elevate either

And my adult self

I don’t know so well

I want to ask if Ballet did this to me as well

## The Dance of Strings

_Audrey Yeo Famille Yeo, Basel City (2023)_

The Bass solo hugs me

Like a gentle soul

His stark eye brows know

That this pain is old

And it embraces the imperfection of my growth

Like the hollow body of the electric tones

Like its structure

Holding a broken soul

While gentle strings

Go curly on the indignant of the young of me

How could a tune

Be so lovely

In a song

Where the dances of the strings

Show us the way

To our love-ability, before today

Whilst the bass saxophone

Share its fluffy tones

telling tales

Of calling good places, a Home

These slow and citrus lights

Lace around a familiar night

Carry melodies with an endearing 

Might

With its gentle Bass

Like arms knowing

How fragile is 

Life

## Sick inside

_Audrey Yeo_, Famille Yeo, (2023)

I know I am sick inside

When the stove only needs checking thrice

When the door handle is tested

Of an embarrassing count

Because I occupied someones mind

And apparently their crown

I am sick a weird amount

My blood was anti-disease

But it was also frought with self-doubt 

And that put her at ease

I read of the symptoms

I am a kind of sick

Grieving for lost faith

In women who awaken allyship

With no intention

to share their privilege

Made me sick from day to late

Working through Saturdays and Sundays

Because they made me feel so

Afraid

I must have been the star of the show: 

For why would two sisters sow their seeds

Just to kill their own ? 

***
## Older brother

_Audrey Yeo, Famille Yeo (2023)_

When you are just a wee little thing

There is something to be said

About the resource in an older sibling

The goods they bring home

Because they can talk and get things

The blame they get in

When our parents don’t understand

We’re in trouble for

A younger sibling’s plan

There is something to be said

When a boy in your brother turns into a man

At his aging jaw

On his side 

I see his failings

Of old behaviors that are repeating

A flaw, a strange, strange phenomenon

Where was my hero and what is he on ?

There is something to be said

To see an older brother fall

Through the hoops and all the asphalt cracks

Because the world only wanted it all

There is something bitter about the fights

He cannot maintain

And the intimacy of a sibling 

He doesn't know how to sustain

The unsettledness of realizing 

The world failed a boy in waiting

Took away the resource he imminently was

And could have been 

To me

The bridge between the real world and what was ours therein

An untapped potential

Of worlds, we are apart

Not knowing the difference

is consequential

To whether we keep

in touch

## Under the Water is the Sages
_Audrey Yeo, Fitzoy Pool, Melbourne, Australia (2012)_

It starts with a drizzle

And it hits your arms

You rise above and the view is marred

Racing grey moist is taken by clumps

The Banshee cries with the angry storm

You rise above the pool and hear

Her cries that dry all wounds beneath

And flutter as you catch on fear

That warmth and shelter isn't near

The wind that tends to whet each drop

Of Rain and sends you to a shock

But you find no way on land to go

Your sight improves as you swim below

Oh dear the view is Clarity

And now you see the route of forces

Of traps and diversions you can go

Your mind's at ease at even losses

And even when the water rises

And Banshee's blood is bled on it

Her cries aren't heard under the water

But my eyes do see where this path leads

The racing clouds do not stop

Fleeting past the ranges

Anarchy or peace it may tell

Under the water is the sages

## The Magic Green of the Rhine
_Audrey Yeo, La Rhine x Burgweg, Switzerland (2021)_

I see how this goes

When things between us start ending

I see the river course reversing

The steps back are crushing

The retracting amount to hurt

You know it was you who waved at me first

I,

See how this goes

When things between us start ending


I saw the sun hit the river and it gloat

The magic green of the Rhine turned to a ghost ...

Destabilizing my universe,

I thought I shared bounds of land with you

And we were mastering our respective fools

A reflection of sun by water

My stature so short did I ever reach the magic river

But the ocean soon came out to dissolve

Green jade of glacier from our mountain tops

The empty expecting mirth

You laughed out loud

Excused by the afternoon wind

It paralyzes me so I can never win

I was drenched by river 

or so I thought

I was once your lover

and now I am not

***
## Diversity Candidate
_Audrey Yeo_, at Gundelingen, Basel City (2022)

I feel exposed

Like the wind caught me

Perforating my soul

Exposed I was two days ago

I am a solo trainee in this once in a lifetime journey

And while I move ahead I think I am slow

But are my frictions making traction or is speed my goal ?

I don't know if it's right to feel a certain instability

Like the world said I could come with

But it could also swallow me

My feet are perched but I feel them cycle in the air

I take flight and feel light but am never anywhere

Or is it that I've landed and I am having a ball

Or that I can feel safe now

But I don't know how to

Anymore
