_Introduction_


These poems are like a revision of histories

Of yours, of mine, of somebody's

They are glimmers explained in cryptic themes

I pluck the root up to discover

My hands have moonshine before

And in poetry I build a home

For orphaned feelings to find lustre

## The Dance of Strings

_Audrey Yeo Famille Yeo, Basel City (2023)_

The Bass solo hugs me

Like a gentle soul

His stark eye brows know

That this pain is old

And it embraces the imperfection of my growth

Like the hollow body of the electric tones

Like its structure

Holding a broken soul

While gentle strings

Go curly on the indignant of the young of me

How could a tune

Be so lovely

In a song

Where the dances of the strings

Show us the way

To our love-ability, before today

Whilst the bass saxophone

Share its fluffy tones

telling tales

Of calling good places, a Home

These slow and citrus lights

Lace around a familiar night

Carry melodies with an endearing 

Might

With its gentle Bass

Like arms knowing

How fragile is 

Life

## The Coping Mechanism
_Audrey Yeo, Ristorante Stella, Locarno, Switzerland (2024)_

The lantern jaw leaning against your left fist

Holding the tilt you made

While watching over me speak

Your eyes saying more than what you said

I saw the wrinkles lighten up

For ninety minutes straight

Do you often invite kind strangers

To take a place in your bed

And assign them as guests

At your parents

Why is your coping mechanism

Making nothing between us happen ?

But you tilt your head as your beaded eyes

Won’t leave my face

If it wasn’t for the screen

We would be tied at the waist

Because we have been once before

Our night in Basel

Now seems like a lore

You might lie to yourself

But our bodies know

What they saw

Which remains nothing of your concern

I know we have magic

But you have your coping mechanism

## Sick inside

_Audrey Yeo_, Famille Yeo, (2023)

I know I am sick inside

When the stove only needs checking thrice

When the door handle is tested

Of an embarrassing count

Because I occupied someones mind

And apparently their crown

I am sick a weird amount

My blood was anti-disease

But it was also frought with self-doubt 

And that put her at ease

I read of the symptoms

I am a kind of sick

Grieving for lost faith

In women who awaken allyship

With no intention

to share their privilege

Made me sick from day to late

Working through Saturdays and Sundays

Because they made me feel so

Afraid

I must have been the star of the show: 

For why would two sisters sow their seeds

Just to kill their own ?

## Under the Water is the Sages
_Audrey Yeo, Fitzoy Pool, Melbourne, Australia (2012)_

It starts with a drizzle

And it hits your arms

You rise above and the view is marred

Racing grey moist is taken by clumps

The Banshee cries with the angry storm

You rise above the pool and hear

Her cries that dry all wounds beneath

And flutter as you catch on fear

That warmth and shelter isn't near

The wind that tends to whet each drop

Of Rain and sends you to a shock

But you find no way on land to go

Your sight improves as you swim below

Oh dear the view is Clarity

And now you see the route of forces

Of traps and diversions you can go

Your mind's at ease at even losses

And even when the water rises

And Banshee's blood is bled on it

Her cries aren't heard under the water

But my eyes do see where this path leads

The racing clouds do not stop

Fleeting past the ranges

Anarchy or peace it may tell

Under the water is the sages

## The Magic Green of the Rhine
_Audrey Yeo, La Rhine x Burgweg, Switzerland (2021)_

I see how this goes

When things between us start ending

I see the river course reversing

The steps back are crushing

The retracting amount to hurt

You know it was you who waved at me first

I,

See how this goes

When things between us start ending


I saw the sun hit the river and it gloat

The magic green of the Rhine turned to a ghost ...

Destabilizing my universe,

I thought I shared bounds of land with you

And we were mastering our respective fools

A reflection of sun by water

My stature so short did I ever reach the magic river

But the ocean soon came out to dissolve

Green jade of glacier from our mountain tops

The empty expecting mirth

You laughed out loud

Excused by the afternoon wind

It paralyzes me so I can never win

I was drenched by river 

or so I thought

I was once your lover

and now I am not

## Diversity Candidate
_Audrey Yeo_, at Gundelingen, Basel City (2022)

I feel exposed

Like the wind caught me

Perforating my soul

Exposed I was two days ago

I am a solo trainee in this once in a lifetime journey

And while I move ahead I think I am slow

But are my frictions making traction or is speed my goal ?

I don't know if it's right to feel a certain instability

Like the world said I could come with

But it could also swallow me

My feet are perched but I feel them cycle in the air

I take flight and feel light but am never anywhere

Or is it that I've landed and I am having a ball

Or that I can feel safe now

But I don't know how to

Anymore
