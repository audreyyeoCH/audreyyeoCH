_Introduction_

These poems are like a revision of histories

Of yours, of mine, of somebody's

They are glimmers explained in cryptic themes

I pluck the root up to discover

My hands have dirt before

And In poetry I build a home

For orphaned feelings to find shelter

## Briefcase energies
_Audrey Yeo_, Silhpost, Zürich (2023)

It's a competition because we regress

if one step is taken the other should be left

I dig into the underside of binary

It’s where we meet our match

Jars will break and butterflies, released

And then you'll hold my hand

The pink and purple amiss

Across the Zürich skies

Saw that I had been

Kissing famous boys

But I tire from lost souls and let them be

For eyes that follow me have briefcase energies

And the binary of this underside

I root for hearts with holes inside

It's where I met a catch

This human with his briefcase, a compass and a map

His chestnut eyes dissolve

The competition it involves

The pink and purple skies, 

I, the sun, and he the flower:

A proper briefcase might

## The ducks and Ama 
_Audrey Yeo_, at the Rhine, Kleinbasel side, Switzerland (2021)

I asked the ducks in the water

If they have seen my Ama

If the water they touch, touched her

If the streams they brush their feathers with

Held all five of her fingers on each of her hand

and tell her... we haven't let her go

and we will one day return

and be hand in hand like

the younger me she would not let go...

I wonder how to reach her

Knowing she is buried down under ...

Will the coffin disintegrate

and rain dilute her to the waters

Will she meet me in Switzerland ?

Where we can be together


Will my Akung's words be true ?

When he said :

"_We will always be with you_"

I know the ducks pass by: "Hello stranger!...

...Do you know my Ama ? ... She was _my_ grandma"

A favourite parent: she liked safety, having enough for us to eat, being clean.

She kept the children healthy

When there was dengue.

Do you know her... little duckies?...

Because in a lot of ways, _I am so much like her_ 

... sturdy, efficient and I like numbers

Will you tell her when you see her to not let us go ?

I know she hates complainers 

but I just miss her so.

## Paper plan
_Audrey Yeo_, Saint Johann, Basel Stadt (2023)

I saw a sun ray taken to dress

Rehearsal is what not what this life is

An orange back pack, a humble paper plan

A head of darkened curls trying to crystalize horizons 

Until I inquired a little more deeply:

Why was he running and did it feel free ?

To the multi-hyphenate smiling at me

He'd lost his map but had done it conscientiously

I listened to the sun ray, and shared my notes

and told him he only needed to choose 

which way he'd like to go

## Marketplace
_Audrey Yeo_, Elisabethen Kirche, Basel Stadt (2023)

What will you do with a blank page

Will it be a story of morality and sage

I promised mine would be interesting when I was eight

Like the Levi's wearing brunette

Leaning against a rain-proof chair

Dapper in blue and collared for the evening

Ready to meet his future something

At the marketplace

A tight rope for me to walk in good faith

To pay things forward without knowing my steps ahead

But I liked that we met at the marketplace

And at my favourite route near Bankverein

I felt your dapper flannel leaning against mine

On purpose and several times

It was obvious that the Irish band playing was a sign

At the market place

Where you found sweetness in our morality and sage

And proceeded to tell me so

I was music to your ears

Till the night brought us home

## The saboteur
_Audrey Yeo_, Famille Yeo, Basel Stadt, 2023

I think I am 

The ageist that matters the most

The contender is me

I make expiry

Dates for sensible tasks

And my wretched head is crushed

By insensible asks

I think I am

The saboteur of my time

I reign with linear 

Parts that do not sum up to feeling fine

A heavy hold to be this bold

My being persists

To achieve all things

And ignore the wholesome bits

I am the uncompromising tone

And forget the kinder ones

When I speak to myself

I demand to be more than enough

I complain I tire easily

From missing expectations 

And their milestones completely

I am the saboteur

Who's not at peace

With what belongs to the world

And what is within reach to me

## Sunshine for itself
_Audrey Yeo_, Gotthelf, Basel Stadt (2023)

I don't know if you noticed

That spring ruined flowers

No shade for relief

No light to nourish

I don't know if you noticed

They took the sunshine for themselves

Nevermind the herbs abreasts

Or the chirping birds in the Innenhof confusing

The east and the west

I don't know if their petals learned

If they were worthy or not 

Will they find all their faces

And only chose one from the lot

The fall is near, 

Their buds already burned

What will sisters scheme next

If they have killed their competition ?

## The Magic Green of the Rhine
_Audrey Yeo_, at the Rhine near Burgweg, Kleinbasel, Switzerland (2021)

I see how this goes

When things between us start ending

I see the river course reversing

The steps back are crushing

The retracting amount to hurt

You know it was you who waved at me first

I,

See how this goes

When things between us start ending


I saw the sun hit the river and it gloat

The magic green of the Rhine turned to a ghost ...

Destabilizing my universe,

I thought I shared bounds of land with you

And we were mastering our respective fools

A reflection of sun by water

My stature so short did I ever reach the magic river

But the ocean soon came out to dissolve

Green jade of glacier from our mountain tops

The empty expecting mirth

You laughed out loud

Excused by the afternoon wind

It paralyzes me so I can never win

I was drenched by river 

or so I thought

I was once your lover

and now I am not
